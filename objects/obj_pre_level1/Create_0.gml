text=@"In 2106, Prometheus, a super AI, 
governs humanity through four modules: 
Protect, Provide, Procreate and Progress. 
A hybrid army
of robots and humans
known as White Dogs
are charged with
protecting Prometheus.

However, cyberattacks by terrorists
against this AI cause an anomaly.
To defend itself, 
Prometheus creates
a secret virtual module
called Purge with the mission
to exterminate humanity.


Former soliders and engineers,
who worked on this AI, 
discover this serious anomaly.
Under the name of
Black Dogs, they unite 
to destroy Prometheus 
and save humanity.";
