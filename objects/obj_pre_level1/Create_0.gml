text=@"In 2106, Prometheus, a super AI, 
governs humanity through four modules: 
Protect, Provide, Procreate and Progress. 
Guarded by the White Dogs, 
a hybrid army, 
Prometheus controls all devices 
on the planet. 

However, unexplained anomalies raise 
doubts about its operation. 
A group of engineers discover 
a secret fifth module 
called Purge, which sees 
humanity as a threat 
and seeks to silently 
eliminate it. 

These engineers, now labeled 
Black Dogs by Prometheus, 
plan to destroy the AI
to save humanity, 
while the White Dogs 
defend the system against 
this subversive threat.";
